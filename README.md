## Features
- Click and drag to increase/decrease the brightness of a dimmable bulb.
- The card takes the same colour as the light, or a default orange colour for bulbs that don't support colour changing (as seen with the "Salt Lamp" in the image below). The primary and secondary colour of the card can be customised.
- Click on the light's icon to toggle the light on/off.
- Click on the chevron to open the "More Info" page for the light. This behaviour can be customised.

## Customisation
![Image 2](img/img2.png)

The image above shows the default configuration for the card. By default, the card will have a subtle glow when the light is on, of the same colour as the bulb (or a default orange). When the light is off, the card uses standard theme colours.

The following customisations are available:

- `name: "Light 1"` sets the displayed name to "Light 1".
- `primary_colour: "#dbdbdb"` sets the card's primary colour to "#dbdbdb".
- `secondary_colour: "#808080"` sets the card's secondary colour to "#808080". 
- `glow: false` disables the glow around the card.
- `opacity: 0.5` makes the card transparent. (`opacity` can take any value from `0.0-1.0`)
- `blur: 3` gives the card a blurred, "frosted" effect. only visible if card is also transparent. (`blur` can take any value from `0.0-10.0`)
- `icon_border: true` enables a border around the light icon, as can be seen in the "Salt Lamp" and "Mini Orb" cards in the above example.
- `icon_border_colour: "#e0e0e0"` sets the icon border colour to "#e0e0e0".
- `card_border: true` enables a border around the card, as can be seen in the "Mini Orb" card in the above example.
- `card_border_colour: "#e0e0e0"` sets the card border colour to "#e0e0e0".
- `off_colours:` customises the colour of the card background and text when the light is off.
- `smart_font_colour: false` disables the smart font colour feature. (This feature determines whether the font is white or black depending on the contrast with the background)
  ```
  off_colours:
    background: "#e0e0e0"
    text: "#e0e0e0"
  ```
  You can also set separate colours for light vs dark mode:
  ```
  off_colours:
    light:
      background: "#e0e0e0"
      text: "#e0e0e0"
    dark:
      background: "#8a8a8a"
      text: "#8a8a8a"
- `chevron_action:` customises the action performed when the chevron is clicked. Default HA action configuration is expected:
  ```
  chevron_action:
    action: url
    url_path: https://github.com/goggybox/compact-light-card/
  ```
  The supported actions are `more-info`, `toggle`, `navigate`, `url`, and `perform-action`/`call-service`.
- `chevron_double_tap_action:` customises the action performed when the chevron is double clicked, configured the same way as `chevron_action:`. By default, there is no action configured for a double tap. 
- `chevron_hold_action:` customises the action performed when the chevron is held, configured the same way as `chevron_action:`. By default, there is no action configured for a hold.

Examples of the customisations:
